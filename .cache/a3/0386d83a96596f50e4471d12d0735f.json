The name in Kashmiri means ‘hot in winter’ i.e. providing comfort to its people. </p> <div class=\"wandhama-locator\"> <img src=\"/wandhama/8856da450dc8ce4133cd5b6e1eeb7e1c.jpg\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"text-map\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> But on 25th January 1998, Wandhama failed to live upto it's name. It witnessed the killing of 23 Kashmiri Hindus in the dead of the night by unidentified gunmen. </p> </div>  <div id=\"text-solo\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> The events of that night are recalled by one of the survivors of the incident, a 14-year-old Hindu boy named Vinod Kuman Dhar alias Ashu. The teenager had slipped away and hidden himself in a dark corner of the house. </p> </div> <div id=\"text-house\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> “The gunmen were dressed like Indian Army soldiers,”, Ashu said piecing the details together. “They had tea with us, waiting for a radio message indicating that all pandit families in the village had been covered.” </p> <div class=\"wandhama-house\"> <img src=\"/wandhama/3f536d14e4c4ea8f0c46ace46f0255ee.png\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"text-bodies\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> After a brief conversation they rounded up all the members of the Hindu households and then gunned them down with Kalashnikov rifles. </p> <div class=\"wandhama-bodies\"> <img src=\"/wandhama/d0aa8cc395c042d0eff543a81a4b3e10.jpg\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"text-victims\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> There was burning smell of the human flesh everywhere. A mother had unsuccessfully tried to save her infant by hiding him in her lap but both got killed together. The cop trying to separate them couldn’t. </p> </div> <div id=\"text-stay\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> The neighbourhood had changed forever. Those killed that night had chosen to stay in the valley despite the fact that majority of their community members had migrated in 1990. </p> </div> <div id=\"text-victims\" class=\"slide text-slide\"> <p> The victims included 10 men, 9 women and 4 children. <span style=\"margin-top:20px;display:block;\">These are their stories.</span> </p> </div>  <div id=\"photos\" class=\"slide\"> <div class=\"photo-row row-1\"> <p class=\"family-name\">X Family</p> </div> <div class=\"photo-row row-2\"> <p class=\"family-name\">Y Family</p> </div> <div class=\"photo-row row-3\"> <p class=\"family-name\">Z family</p> </div> <div class=\"photo-row row-4\"> <p class=\"family-name\">W family</p> </div> <div class=\"pic-description\"> <p class=\"name\"></p> <p class=\"age\"></p> </div> </div> </body><script src=\"/wandhama/ca536e47f3f828a66947fddf7b1dc418.js\"></script></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"470831c7557bbe581c91a4f527c073c8","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
