      Wandhama is a quiet village in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district. The name in Kashmiri means ‘hot in winter’
      i.e. providing comfort to its people.

  <!-- the gunmen came to their house dressed like Indian Army soldiers, had tea with them, waiting for a radio message indicating that all Hindu families in the village had been covered. After a brief conversation they rounded up all the members of the Hindu households and then summarily gunned them down with Kalashnikov rifles.[8] The massacre was allegedly committed under Abdul Hamid Gada of the Hizbul Mujahideen and was timed to coincide with the Shab-e-Qadar, the holiest night of the month of Ramzan, when believers stay awake until dawn.[9] Gada was subsequently shot dead by Indian security forces in 2000.[10] -->

      The events of that night are recalled by one of the survivors of the incident, a 14-year-old Hindu boy named Vinod
      Kuman Dhar alias Ashu. The teenager had slipped away and hidden himself in a dark corner of the house.
