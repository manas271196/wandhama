            Wandhama is a quiet village in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district. The name in Kashmiri means ‘hot in
            winter’
            i.e. providing comfort to its people.

            But on 25th January 1998, Wandhama failed to live upto it's name.
            It witnessed the killing of 23 Kashmiri Hindus in the dead of the night by unidentified gunmen.

After a brief conversation they rounded up all the members of the Hindu households and then summarily gunned them down with Kalashnikov rifles.[8] The massacre was allegedly committed under Abdul Hamid Gada of the Hizbul Mujahideen and was timed to coincide with the Shab-e-Qadar, the holiest night of the month of Ramzan, when believers stay awake until dawn.[9] Gada was subsequently shot dead by Indian security forces in 2000.[10] -->

            The events of that night are recalled by one of the survivors of the incident, a 14-year-old Hindu boy named
            Vinod
            Kuman Dhar alias Ashu. The teenager had slipped away and hidden himself in a dark corner of the house.

            covered.”
